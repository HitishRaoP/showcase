# Personal Portfolio

A modern, minimalist personal portfolio website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Why Vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript?

I chose to build this portfolio using vanilla web technologies instead of modern frameworks for several reasons:

- **Framework Fatigue**: The JavaScript ecosystem is constantly evolving with new frameworks, build tools, and best practices. What's popular today might be outdated tomorrow.
- **Maintenance Simplicity**: Vanilla technologies don't require dependency updates, breaking changes, or migration efforts. The code I write today will work the same way years from now.
- **Performance**: No framework overhead means faster load times and better performance out of the box.
- **Learning Focus**: Building with vanilla technologies helps maintain a deep understanding of the web fundamentals.
- **Longevity**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the foundation of the web and aren't going anywhere. This portfolio will remain functional and maintainable for years to come.

Built with ❤️ using vanilla web technologies for maximum simplicity and longevity.
